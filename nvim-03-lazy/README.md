I'm tired of things breaking and constant updating, so I'm giving up on smart stuff - formatters, LSPs, Treesitter...

If I need to edit any of that, I'm just going to use VS Code - including for nvim configs, which need formatting, etc...

Let's keep my NeoVim config focused on quick text edits and as stable as I can make it.

As part of this, I'm not modifying standard vim locations - see https://www.lazyvim.org/installation for locations
