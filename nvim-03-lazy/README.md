I'm tired of things breaking and constant updating, so I'm giving up on smart stuff - formatters, LSPs, Treesitter...

If I need to edit any of that, I'm just going to use VS Code - including for nvim configs, which need formatting, etc...

Let's keep my NeoVim config focused on quick text edits and as stable as I can make it.

As part of this, I'm not modifying standard vim locations.

How to back up current nvim files before installing (thanks https://www.lazyvim.org/installation ):

```bash
# required
mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}

# optional but recommended
mv ~/.local/share/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.local/state/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.cache/nvim{,.bak}
```

Or just delete them:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.cache/nvim
```

Symlink nvim config dir:

```bash
fling link -s nvim-03-lazy
```

On Linux, `xsel` is needed for clipboard interaction:

```bash
sudo apt install xsel
```

Open `nvim` - note that it'll freeze for a tad the first time because it's cloning `lazy.nvim` with git. Wait for that and then it'll all work out......
