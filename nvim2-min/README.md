vim.opt vs vim.o ? I think it's that vim.opt is more powerful and more verboseÂ https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide#using-meta-accessors

# Adding Packer

It looks like I need to modify the packpath when I download packer:


See it with `:set packpath?'

```
packpath=
/etc/xdg/nvim
/etc/xdg/nvim/after
/usr/local/Cellar/neovim/0.7.2_1/share/nvim/runtime
/usr/local/Cellar/neovim/0.7.2_1/lib/nvim
/usr/local/share/nvim/site/after
/usr/local/share/nvim/site
/usr/share/nvim/site
/usr/share/nvim/site/after
~/.config/nvim
~/.config/nvim/after
~/.local/share/nvim/site
~/.local/share/nvim/site/after
```

I can set it with https://superuser.com/a/1466466/643441

# Adding Tree-sitter + Markdown

Painless so far... TODO: get a colorscheme that hightlights the text in code blocks and check long files

using material.nvim - the code block text isn't highlighting code differently than block text..

# TODO

- Install packer.nvim and use it to install a commenting plugin - make sure packer puts stuff into ~/.config/nvim
- Install markdown plugins (tree-sitter)
