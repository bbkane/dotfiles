Now that I'm using Coc with NeoVim, it takes a second to load all that autocomplete goodness :(

So I'm keeping a super minimal vimrc so I can set VISUAL to it in .zshrc_common.zsh . Then I can use C-x,C-e to edit in fast-loading vim.

Note: this might not be the [correct use of `$VISUAL`](https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/4859/185953) but it'll probably work for me :)
