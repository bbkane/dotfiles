## Wezterm

Trying to switch from iTerm2 for the following reasons:

- iTerm2 has a harder to reason about config file
- this is supposed to be faster, though I've never felt slowed by iTerm2
- Cross platform if I move to Linux
- A buncha built-in color schemes

Font looks odd, but that could be ok. I think it's a different font

Need to adjust font size in lua config

To open a link, you shift click it (not cmd click like MacOS). I think I should
get used to that as it's more cross platform -
