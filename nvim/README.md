# nvim

My Neovim Config. Also works for Vim.

## NeoVim Install

- Back up old config

```
mv "$HOME/.config/nvim" "$HOME/.config/nvim.$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
```

- Stow the repository

```
mkdir -p "$HOME/.config"
fling nvim
```

NOTE: I can't rename `.config` to `dot-config` because of https://github.com/aspiers/stow/issues/33 Hopefully that'll be fixed at some point

## Vim Install

- Backup ~/.vimrc and ~/.vim/

```
mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc.$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
mv ~/.vim ~/.vim.$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

- Create symlinks

```
ln -s ~/.config/nvim/init.vim ~/.vimrc
ln -s ~/.config/nvim/ ~/.vim
```

## Install Plugins (from editor)

- Install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug): `:InstallVimPlug`
- Restart editor
- Install Plugins: `:PlugInstall`

## Install linters for Ale

Alternative installation options for Python deps: nvim venv , pipx. nvim venv doesn't expose tools to anything else. pipx (ironically) doesn't have a clean installation method (`python3 -m pip install --user pipx` installs other dependencies (could use homebrew to install it, but...)). Homebrew only works on mac and doesn't have formulas for everything (and some it does have are out of date)

```
brew install black flake8 mypy shellcheck shfmt
```

TODO: I think `mypy` is replaced by Pyright - I also think but have not tested that `gofmt` is installed by `brew install go`

## Install [Coc](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) + [pyright](https://github.com/fannheyward/coc-pyright)

Install node: `volta install node`

### Install Language Servers

```
:CocList extensions  # see installed extensions
:CocInstall coc-json coc-pyright coc-go
:CocConfig  # edit json
```

### Notes

TODO: https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions#use-vims-plugin-manager-for-coc-extension
NOTE: `let g:coc_node_path = '/path/to/node'`

```
:CocCommand pyright.organizeimports
```

## Vim QuickInstall

Just the basic `~/.vimrc`- no plugins or anything. Useful for servers

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bbkane/nvim/master/init.vim > ~/.vimrc
```

[Vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary) is one plugin I feel like I can't do without. Manually install it with:

```
curl --create-dirs -fLo ~/.vim/plugin/commentary.vim https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpope/vim-commentary/master/plugin/commentary.vim
```

## Notes

TODO: move this to blog?

In normal mode: `q:`, `q/`, `q?` open up command and search history in a nice little popup window
